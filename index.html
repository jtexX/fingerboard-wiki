  <h1>Fingerboard Wiki... Sort of</h1>
  <h3>History</h3>
  <p> Fingerboards first existed as homemade toys in the late 1960s and later became 
    a novelty attached to keychains in skate shops In the 1985 Powell-Peralta 
    skateboarding video "Future Primitive," Lance Mountain rode a homemade fingerboard 
    in a double-bin sink. Some consider this the earliest fingerboard footage available 
    for public viewing. That homemade fingerboard was built from wood, tubes, and toy train axles.
  </p>
  <p> Somerville International's Fingerboard brand, established in 1987, was the first
    to mass-produce fingerboards with licensed-actual skateboard graphics with the 
    introduction of the Pro-Precision board. Since their introduction, the brand has
    undergone numerous changes in naming convention, product designs, and partnerships. 
    Most notably their partnership with McDonalds to produce fingerboards for Happy Meal 
    toys in the early 2000s. They are also credited to the first mass-produced wooden 
    fingerboard, utilizing parts from their 2nd generation fingerboards.
  </p>
  <p>  One of the first 
    companies to design and manufacture fingerboard ramps was Buckledown (Buckledown Products). 
    Instead of a popular toy store, you had to get their products in skateboard equipment 
    catalog such as CCS, or had to hope your local skateshop stocked a few. Buckledown 
    holds the first U.S. Patent to a fingerboard ramp design. Shortly after, a brand called 
    "Berzerk" by Hobbico produced fingerboard kit ramps out of a coroplast material. 
    These ramps had an eerily strong resemblance to the Buckledown kit ramps. 
    On the back of the Berzerk packaging, a website link that read "www.techdeck.com"

  <p>Shortly after in 1999, Tech Deck, now claimed by X-Concepts hit every toy store 
    across the United States with a redesigned ramp kit, and a more accurate model of 
    a skateboard compared to the Pro-Precision boards. X-Concepts followed Somerville's 
    ideology with licensed pro graphics from major skateboard brands, as well as designs
    harnessed from entertainment properties such as "Speed Racer," "Woody Woodpecker," 
    "NASCAR," "Heavy Metal," and "Crash Bandicoot." As fingerboards became more prominent
    outside the skateboarding community, in 1999 there was a Tech Deck fashion of collecting 
    one of each design similar to the Beanie Baby fad months prior.

  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <p>Fingerboards are used by a range of people from those utilising them as toys to 
    skateboarding and related sports professionals envisioning not only their own skating 
    maneuvers but for others as well and can include the use for planning out competition 
    courses as skateboarding develops into an international sport. Similar to train 
    enthusiasts building railway models, fingerboard hobbyists often construct and purchase 
    reduced scale model figures that would be considered natural features to an urban 
    skateboarder such as handrails, benches, and stairs they would be likely to encounter 
    while skating. In addition users might build and buy items seen in a skatepark including 
    half-pipes, quarter pipes, trick boxes, vert ramps, pyramids, banked ramps, full 
    pipes, and any number of other trick-oriented objects.

  <h3>Pieces</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Deck: Fingerboard decks are made out of plastic or wood. The shapes vary from popsicle decks, 
      cruiser decks and old school decks. Modern and/or higher quality decks have a defined nose and 
      tail just like a real skateboard. Over the years decks got wider, for example old "Berlin Wood" 
      decks were 29mm wide, while today decks range from 32mm-34mm</li>
    <li>Trucks: Trucks are mostly mass-produced from metal for the toy industry. In recent years, however, 
      there have also been manufacturers who produce special trucks specifically for the sport and thereby 
      set significantly higher standards for quality in lower quantities.</li>
    <li>Wheels: Wheels are made of plastic, metal or resin, widely spread is Polyutherane (same Material used in Skateboard-Wheels) as it gives a firm grip. Higher quality wheels are also equipped with bearings. They are either cast, 3D printed or machined on a lathe (or their industrial equivalent).</li>
    <li>Tape: For better adhesion, a Griptape is glued to the deck, which consists of either rubber, neoprene or fine-grain skateboard grip.</li>
    <li>Screws: Are the screws that attach the trucks to the deck.</li>

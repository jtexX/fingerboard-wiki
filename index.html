  <h1>Fingerboard Wiki... Sort of</h1>
  <h3>History</h3>
  <p> Fingerboards first existed as homemade toys in the late 1960s and later became 
    a novelty attached to keychains in skate shops In the 1985 Powell-Peralta 
    skateboarding video "Future Primitive," Lance Mountain rode a homemade fingerboard 
    in a double-bin sink. Some consider this the earliest fingerboard footage available 
    for public viewing. That homemade fingerboard was built from wood, tubes, and toy train axles.

  <p> Somerville International's Fingerboard brand, established in 1987, was the first
    to mass-produce fingerboards with licensed-actual skateboard graphics with the 
    introduction of the Pro-Precision board. Since their introduction, the brand has
    undergone numerous changes in naming convention, product designs, and partnerships. 
    Most notably their partnership with McDonalds to produce fingerboards for Happy Meal 
    toys in the early 2000s. They are also credited to the first mass-produced wooden 
    fingerboard, utilizing parts from their 2nd generation fingerboards.

  <p>  One of the first 
    companies to design and manufacture fingerboard ramps was Buckledown (Buckledown Products). 
    Instead of a popular toy store, you had to get their products in skateboard equipment 
    catalog such as CCS, or had to hope your local skateshop stocked a few. Buckledown 
    holds the first U.S. Patent to a fingerboard ramp design. Shortly after, a brand called 
    "Berzerk" by Hobbico produced fingerboard kit ramps out of a coroplast material. 
    These ramps had an eerily strong resemblance to the Buckledown kit ramps.

  <p>Shortly after in 1999, Tech Deck, now claimed by X-Concepts hit every toy store 
    across the United States with a redesigned ramp kit, and a more accurate model of 
    a skateboard compared to the Pro-Precision boards. X-Concepts followed Somerville's 
    ideology with licensed pro graphics from major skateboard brands, as well as designs
    harnessed from entertainment properties such as "Speed Racer," "Woody Woodpecker," 
    "NASCAR," "Heavy Metal," and "Crash Bandicoot." As fingerboards became more prominent
    outside the skateboarding community, in 1999 there was a Tech Deck fashion of collecting 
    one of each design similar to the Beanie Baby fad months prior.

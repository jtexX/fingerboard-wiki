  <h1>Fingerboard Wiki... Sort of</h1>
  <h3>History</h3>
  <p> Fingerboards first existed as homemade toys in the late 1960s and later became 
    a novelty attached to keychains in skate shops In the 1985 Powell-Peralta 
    skateboarding video "Future Primitive," Lance Mountain rode a homemade fingerboard 
    in a double-bin sink. Some consider this the earliest fingerboard footage available 
    for public viewing. That homemade fingerboard was built from wood, tubes, and toy train axles.

  <p> Somerville International's Fingerboard brand, established in 1987, was the first
    to mass-produce fingerboards with licensed-actual skateboard graphics with the 
    introduction of the Pro-Precision board. Since their introduction, the brand has
    undergone numerous changes in naming convention, product designs, and partnerships. 
    Most notably their partnership with McDonalds to produce fingerboards for Happy Meal 
    toys in the early 2000s.
